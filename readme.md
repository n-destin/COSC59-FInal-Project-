# Lisp Interpreter and Unification Algorithm in C++

## Overview

1. **Lisp Interpreter**: A minimalist Lisp interpreter designed to parse and evaluate Lisp expressions. This component demonstrates the principles of functional programming and symbolic computation, making it a great tool for learning and experimentation.

2. **Unification Algorithm**: A C++ implementation of a unification algorithm, which is a core concept in logic programming. It can determine whether two expressions can be made identical by systematically substituting variables, making it an essential tool in fields like automated reasoning and Prolog-like languages.

## Features

- **Lisp Interpreter**:
  - Supports basic Lisp syntax and operations.
  - Parses and evaluates expressions with precision.
  - Lightweight and easily extensible for additional functionality.

- **Unification Algorithm**:
  - Performs variable substitution to unify expressions.
  - Handles logical constructs efficiently.
  - A practical example of how unification works in computational logic.


## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/n-destin/COSC59-FInal-Project-.git
   ```
2. Compile the code using your preferred C++ compiler:
   ```bash
   g++ -o lisp_interpreter lisp_interpreter.cpp
   g++ -o unification_algorithm unification_algorithm.cpp
   ```
3. Run the programs:
   - For the Lisp interpreter:
     ```bash
     ./lisp_interpreter
     ```
   - For the unification algorithm:
     ```bash
     ./unification_algorithm
     ```
